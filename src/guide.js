    `<p>Your <b>handle</b> is your street name. It's what the other players and the GM call you.</p>
     <p>Your <b>role</b> is your profession. It sets your ten career skills and gives you a <b>special ability</b> no other role has. Pick the one that sounds most fun to play; there are no wrong choices.</p>
     <p><b>Concept</b> is one line about who you are. It helps the GM build stories around you. Age doesn't change your stats, but every year past 16 gives you a life event in the Lifepath step.</p>`,
    `<p>Stats run from <b>2</b> (awful) to <b>10</b> (the best a normal human gets); 5–6 is average. You spread a pool of points across all nine. Cinematic pools go from 50 (an average person) to 80 (a major hero); most groups use 60–70, so ask your GM.</p>
     <p>As a <b>${esc(c.role)}</b>, put your best numbers in <b>${r.stats.join(", ")}</b>.</p>
     <p>Almost every roll in the game is <b>stat + skill + 1D10</b>, trying to reach a target number the GM sets. The numbers under the stats update as you go.</p>`,
    `<p>You get <b>40 points</b> for your role's ten career skills, including your special ability. No skill can go above 10.</p>
     <p>What a level means: <b>1–2</b> beginner · <b>3–4</b> competent · <b>5–6</b> professional · <b>7–8</b> expert · <b>9–10</b> one of the best.</p>
     <p>Targets the GM sets: Easy <b>10</b> · Average <b>15</b> · Difficult <b>20</b> · Very difficult <b>25</b> · Nearly impossible <b>30</b>. With a stat of 6 and a skill of 4 you roll 1D10 + 10, so an Average task works 6 times in 10. A natural 10 rolls again and adds; a natural 1 is a fumble.</p>
     <p><b>${esc(ROLES[c.role].ab)}:</b> ${esc(r.ability)} A 4–6 is a good start.</p>`,
    `<p>Pickup skills are everything else you learned on the street. You get <b>REF + INT</b> points to spend on any skill, including more points in your career skills.</p>
     <p>Good picks for almost anyone: <b>Awareness/Notice</b> (spotting danger), <b>Dodge & Escape</b>, <b>Athletics</b>, a weapon skill, and <b>Streetwise</b>.</p>
     <p>Skills marked <b>×2</b> or <b>×3</b> don't cost more points now; they just cost more Improvement Points to raise later.</p>`,
    `<p>The lifepath is your backstory, built from random tables: your style, your family, what drives you, and one event for each year since you were 16.</p>
     <p>Enemies, friends and lovers you roll here are <b>story hooks</b>. Tell your GM about them, because they may turn up in play.</p>
     <p>Roll everything with one button, reroll any line you don't like, or type over it with your own idea.</p>`,
    `<p>Your role pays a <b>monthly income</b> based on your special ability level. Starting cash is a few months of it.</p>
     <p><b>Weapons:</b> WA is a bonus or penalty to hit. Damage is the dice you roll when you hit. ROF is shots per turn. Rel is reliability (VR very reliable, ST standard, UR unreliable). Conc is how easy it is to hide (P pocket, J jacket, L long coat, N can't hide).</p>
     <p><b>Armor:</b> SP is stopping power, taken off every hit to that body part. EV is how much heavy armor slows you; it lowers your REF.</p>
     <p><b>Cyberware:</b> every implant costs Humanity, rolled when you buy it. Each 10 Humanity lost drops your EMP by 1, and at EMP 0 you're a cyberpsycho and the GM takes over. Chrome is powerful; spend Humanity carefully.</p>`,
    `<p>Anything flagged here is a reminder, not a rule; your GM can approve anything.</p>

const SHEET_TIPS={
  skills:`Tap a stat or a skill's roll button to roll it: <b>stat + skill + 1D10</b>. Pick a <b>Target</b> first and the result tells you whether you beat it. The GM awards <b>Improvement Points</b> (IP) for good play; raising a skill costs its current level × 10 IP, more for ×2 and ×3 skills.`,
  combat:`<b>Initiative</b> is REF + 1D10 (Solos add Combat Sense); highest acts first. <b>Attack</b> is REF + weapon skill + WA + 1D10 against the range number. <b>Damage:</b> roll the weapon's dice, subtract the armor SP where you were hit, double it for head hits, then subtract your BTM. The calculator below does it for you.`,
  cyber:`<b>Humanity</b> is your grip on being human. Every implant costs some; each 10 points lost lowers EMP by 1, and at EMP 0 you go cyberpsycho. Therapy, arranged with the GM, can win some back.`,
  gear:`Track your cash here. Rent, food and other lifestyle costs come due every month; <b>Pay this month</b> takes them off in one go.`,
  lifepath:`Your backstory. Enemies and friends make good story hooks, so tell your GM about them.`,

  stats:`Tap a stat to roll it. <b>Luck</b> is a pool you spend to add to rolls; it refills each session.`,
  wounds:`Each box is 1 point of damage. <b>Light:</b> no effect · <b>Serious:</b> −2 REF · <b>Critical:</b> REF, INT and COOL halved · <b>Mortal:</b> cut to a third, and you make a death save every turn. After a hit, make a <b>stun save</b>: roll 1D10 at or under the number shown or be knocked out.`,
  armor:`<b>SP</b> at each body part is taken off every hit there. Each time a hit gets through, that armor loses 1 SP until repaired.`,
